# EIM

In first commit I added:

- the new data I found online
- variable xmin that let's you specify when to start to plot
- a pie chart function (used in the pareto optimal, that let's you compare with cost optimized and co2 optimized)
- a new constraint (search for "self reliance") (It's prob not the best way to implement it, just wanted to try what the results would look like)
- changed excel data to scale the demand, but I saw later that you actually did that in the code so I took it away in the code
